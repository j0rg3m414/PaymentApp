Project to practice study of features from Java 17 and 21.

In intension to make an API, more especificaly response structure, developers expected a consistent and clear structure. A good API of kind response should:

### Be predictable
Use the same format for success and error responses.
### Be informative
Provide relevant data and metadata.
### Be descriptive
Clearly indicate the status of the request.
### Be simple
Avoid unnecessery complexity.

## Benefits of Structured API Responses
### Consistency: 
Every response follows a predictable format.
### Debugging: 
Easier to understand and troubleshoot issues.
### Ease of Integration: 
Consumers of your API can handle responses more effectively.
### Reusability: 
Generic response wrappers reduce boilerplate code.

Trying follow these principles, I make this API more friendly and maintainnable.
